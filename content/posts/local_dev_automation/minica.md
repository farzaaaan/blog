one final config we need would be adding SSL to our [gitea](#gitea) endpoint. this is because to use the docker repository hosted on gitea we need to run `docker login` and it requires a secure connection.

there are several ways to achieve this, ranging from the [basic openssl method](), to using custom libraries such as [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and [minica](https://github.com/jsha/minica). I decided to use the latter, but any of the above work. 

to create a root certificate, and subsequently a certificate for our local dns endpoints we could do:
{{< notice "tip" >}}
  whichever method you choose to use, you'd still need to install the root certificate on every machine that's involved in your workflow. this includes your desktop/laptop as well as docker hosts and containers.

  ```bash
  # - Run below.
  # - Double click on .pfx to install. choose local machine, and choose Trusted Root.. Store.
  # - Go to Cert Manager, find minica. Double Click -> Details Tab -> \
  #   Copy to File. Anywhere you want.
  # - Go to generated .cer file, double click, install for local machine \
  #   in Trusted Root... Store.
  # - Restart browsers.
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out rootCA.pfx -inkey rootCA.key -in rootCA.pem
